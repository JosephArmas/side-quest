In collaboration with a team of 6, we developed *Utification*, a web application hosted on AWS that serves to promote awareness of litter,
vandalism and abandoned items in California communities. *Utiﬁcation* utilizes Google Maps API
to create visual maps of locations, fostering a cleaner environment.
- Led a team of six through all phases in the software development life cycle, employing continuous‬
‭integration and continuous deployment practices along with agile methodology to ensure on-time‬
‭project milestones
- Implemented a Microservices backend architecture alongside the Model-View-Controller (MVC)‬
‭pattern using C#, .NET6+, ASP.NET CORE. The system comprised of 5 abstraction layers,‬
‭optimizing system modularity, scalability, extensibility, and maintainability
- ‭Incorporated industry-standard design patterns and adhered to SOLID principles, ensuring‬
‭high-quality, maintainable, and scalable code
- ‭Crafted clear, concise, and comprehensive [documentation](), including [*Request for Proposal (RFP)*](), [*Business Requirement Document (BRD)*](), and‬ [*DAR Reports*](), elevating project clarity and system robustness
- Utilized MSTest to test each abstraction layer of the backend, and employed ![cypress](https://img.shields.io/badge/-cypress-%23E5E5E5?style=for-the-badge&logo=cypress&logoColor=058a5e) for‬
‭comprehensive end-to-end test to verify overall system functionality and user interaction flows
- Deployed the single page application on ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white), leveraging its scalable infrastructure to ensure high‬
‭availability for its users
- ‭Integrated Google Maps API to spotlight litter, vandalism, and abandoned items, fostering towards‬
‭cleaner California communities‬
- Engineered the entire *Events feature* and client-side UI functionality using 	![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white), enhancing intuitive navigation and subsequently amplifying user engagement and participation.
- **Events feature:** allows reputable users on our application the ability to place an
"event" pin on the map. This allows regular, reputable and service type users to
interactively participate and contribute by joining events
