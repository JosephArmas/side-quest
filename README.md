### **Projects**
- **Single Web Application**\
This web application was developed by using C#, .NET Core Framework, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It aims to unify communites by increasing awarness through an interactive map featuring various types of pins. Its purpose is to encourage individuals to conform and contribute to build a cleaner environment.
- **Discord realtime crypto tracker**\
I used another project as reference for configs, however I utilize Digital Ocean to have a server regularly grab real time crypto prices for XLM, XRP, and SOLANA from coingecko. I then linked and displayed on my discord server by creating a bot and its own separate role.
- **Linux custom configs / scripts**\
I created custom commands and scripts with shell script to use through CLI to improve productivity and flexibility. I also use a combination of shell scripting and css to customize config files to alter Gnome Desktop visuals
- **Client & Server**\
This console applications was created by using Java. The way it works is to have one instance on the cloud act a Server and another instance to act as a Client. Both instances are able to communicate to eachother by sending messages via CLI through an open port.
- **Threat analysis**\
I was given a scenario on a company, I  analyzed and identified 100 potenital threats and vulnerabilites. Additinally, I have developed a set of suggested mitgations to enhance the company's security.
- **Database Design**\
I designed a database for a school to keep track of employees borrowing keys to certain rooms in a building. I utilized Diagrams.io to design the overall structure of the project and created tables in PosgreSql. I created a console program using Python and Sql Alchemy (ORM) to store data in PostgreSQL. Additionaly, I use the same console program, but incorporate Pymongo to store data in Mongo DB.
- **Personal Cloud service using Nextcloud**\
I had extra physical hard drives, therefore I decided to store my own personal files and media on Nextcloud that is linked to a custom domain, TLS/SSL for security and also port forwarding on my local router so that it can be accessed anywhere.
  
  ### **Goals for 2023**
  - Django Framework
  - React 
  - TypeScript
  - Game Development with Unity
  - Mobile Application with Swift
